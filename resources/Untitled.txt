Open terminal / console. Then walk and explain to students what each of the following commands does.

cd (changes directory)

cd ~ (changes to home directory)

cd .. (moves up one directory)

ls (lists files in folder)

pwd (shows current directory)

mkdir <FOLDERNAME> (creates new directory)

touch <FILENAME> (creates a file)

rm <FILENAME> (deletes file)

rm -r <FOLDERNAME> (deletes a folder, note the -r)

open . (opens the current folder. MAC SPECIFIC)

open <FILENAME> (opens a specific file. MAC SPECIFIC)

explorer <FILENAME> (opens the specific file. BASH SPECIFIC)

explorer . (opens the current folder. BASH SPECIFIC)

Tabbing

Pressing the tab key after typing "cd fol" will autocomplete to "cd foldername", assuming foldername is unique. (Folder/Filename Autocomplete - Show students what happens when there are unique and multiple options based on what they typed.)
